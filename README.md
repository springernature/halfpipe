# Hello!

<a href="https://concourse.halfpipe.io/teams/engineering-enablement/pipelines/halfpipe-cli"><img src="http://badger.halfpipe.io/engineering-enablement/halfpipe-cli" title="badge"></a>

This is the friendly Halfpipe CLI. Try it out :)

## Friendly Halfpipe CLI huh?

Yeah, it takes a small YAML schema and renders a complete Concourse pipeline for you

## How does it work? This README is kinda slim...

[All documentation and further information can be found here](https://docs.halfpipe.io)

## Ah! That's cool, can I use it in my company?

In theory yes, but there is some Springer Nature specific stuff in here. With that said nothing is stopping us from extracting those bits, submit a issue! :)

## How do I test and build?

Halfpipe is built with Go

```
./build.sh

# or if you don't have Go installed you can build in docker
./docker-build.sh
```

# CI

The main pipeline is in [Concourse](https://concourse.halfpipe.io/teams/engineering-enablement/pipelines/halfpipe-cli)

It runs the build script on every commit to `main`.

We also use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/springernature/halfpipe/actions) for dependabot and CodeQL scanning


# Updating Dependencies


### go

dependabot will raise PRs. Alternatively, to manually update all deps:

```bash
go get -t -u ./... && go mod tidy
```

### GitHub actions 

For third party actions we use in halfpipe rendered workflows - 
dependabot will raise PRs but these are just informational, we have to manually update the halfpipe actions renderer. 


# Releasing

Releasing is triggered by manually [bumping the version (major, minor or patch) in Concourse](https://concourse.halfpipe.io/teams/engineering-enablement/pipelines/halfpipe-cli). Binaries are built for different platforms and published to artifactory. The halfpipe cli checks artifactory for a newer release and updates itself. A [GitHub release](https://github.com/springernature/halfpipe/releases) is also created.
